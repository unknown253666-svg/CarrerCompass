Memory Usage Optimization
-------------------------
The application uses several memory-intensive libraries:
- sentence-transformers
- spaCy with en_core_web_sm model
- scikit-learn

To reduce memory usage:
1. Using the "starter" plan on Render instead of "free" plan
2. Limiting file upload size to 16MB
3. Optimizing model loading with lazy initialization

If memory issues persist:
1. Consider using a more lightweight sentence transformer model
2. Reduce the maximum file upload size
3. Upgrade to a higher-tier Render plan
